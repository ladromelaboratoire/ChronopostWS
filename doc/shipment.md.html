                        **Shipment**
                           Version 1.0


This documentation describes the way to construct a Shipment object to maximize chances to get skybills from Chronopost webservices. The shipment object is a versatile object to allow evolutions. All public properties may be used by SoapClient to make request.

This object is constructed by Chronopost Object of the module.  It receives all the data you want to load as long as there is a __setter__ method available. Using setters allows to control carefully the data against the WS rules.
